While we were all or at least some of us in the Miluim, I had some time to write a small application that would answer a very big need of mine. Those who know me know how much I love to read, and I have reached the point where my wife and I have hundreds of books at home (around 350). Our problem was that we couldn't keep track of them, who we lent to, when they were added to the library, etc.

So, I wrote a desktop app to help us organize all of this.

Language: C#
Database: PostgreSQL
Really uses: C# Forms

All providers come from the API of the National Library of Israel (which contains most of the books in Hebrew and also additional books in other languages).

I have to say that it was challenging to write it and it took me some time to crack how to properly access the API and also of course how to save the data in the database. I deliberately chose a relational database to practice something a little more complex that requires planning and maintenance in advance. However, after the challenge, I am very satisfied with the result and the study.

I hope you'll like it :)
